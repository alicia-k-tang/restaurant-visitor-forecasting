# visitor-forecasting

## Introduction
For this class assignment, we were tasked with participating in [Kaggle’s Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting)
competition. The context of the competition is set in Japan, where participants
were given restaurant and visitor data in order to predict the future number of daily visitors.
Knowing this information provides an incredibly valuable tool for restaurant businesses. In
particular, accurate visitor predictions could aim to help with one of the most uncertain aspects
of the business— how to prepare.
Being ready for the amount of customers that come in each day include purchasing the
correct amount of stock, where no more and no less is used, as well as scheduling enough
workers for the day. It is difficult to prepare these things without knowing the number of visitors.
Better preparation, in turn, increases the overall efficiency for restaurants. Once the proper
number of resources are determined, more effort can be focused on brainstorming ways of giving
consumers a better experience— one without any sort of delay in service, and one with a better
dining aspect. Accurately predicting the number of visitors leads to a win-win situation for both
restaurants and consumers, making it an important problem to analyze.
